        Staff page to create new events, invite people and handout bicycles.

    There exist two different main views you can select. These
    views present you a summary of the informations currently stored in the
    database.
    <div style="line-height:90%;"><br></div>
    The
    <a href="{% url 'staff:event_overview' %}">Event View</a>
    is what you probably need most of the time when handing
    out bicycles to already registered persons. It shows the people that have
    been invited and it is possible to handout bicycles.
    <div style="line-height:90%;"><br></div>
    The
    <a href="{% url 'staff:candidate_overview' %}">Candidate View</a>
    is to have an overview over all people in the database. It is possible to
    manually register new persons that do not have an email address or a
    telefon number. Furthermore, you can take back bicycles from people
    that have registered long time ago.
    <div style="line-height:90%;"><br></div>
    The
    <a href="{% url 'staff:bicycle_overview' %}">Bicycle View</a>
    shows all bicycles that have been handed out so far.
